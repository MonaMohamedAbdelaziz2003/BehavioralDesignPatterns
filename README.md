# BehavioralDesignPatterns :
<h4><li>Behavioral design patterns are a subset of design patterns in software engineering that deal with the interaction and responsibilities of objects. These patterns focus on how objects communicate and work together to achieve common tasks</li></h4>
<h4><li>Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</li> </h4>

<h3><a href="Chain of Responsibility">1- Chain of Responsibility</a></h3>
<li>
 Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets
 you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a
 request, each handler decides either to process the request or

<h3><a href="command">2- Command</a></h3>
<li>
 Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request
 into a stand-alone object that contains all information about
 the request. This transformation lets you parameterize
 methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s
 execution, and support undoable operations.
